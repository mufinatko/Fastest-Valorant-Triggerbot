# Fastest-Valorant-Triggerbot
By far the fastest available python triggerbot out there, no joke its speed is pretty crazy.

How to setup

first extract the file

If you you're a coder, you can use the source, if not please proceed to use the exe.

Start Exe, Start Valorant, go to ingame settings and use purple outline.

While being in ingame settings go to keybinds and add K as a second shoot keybind.

By default shift is the hotkey, if you have always enabled turn on, use f10 instead.

Should work

Additionally you can change the color tolerance, I recommend 20-70, also a delay can be added, => config.json
